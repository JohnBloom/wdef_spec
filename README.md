This is the specification document for the workout data exchange format. Data is at the heart of understanding progress. Back in the day people used to use pen and paper and that was good enough. Now we collect all of this data digitally and while that makes analyzing them easier this data can get fragmented and siloed in different systems. These systems all implement their own import and export requirements which can make getting the data out of one and into another difficult. WDEF is an effort to provide a common exchange formate for workourt data inorder to facilite the moving and compiling of data.
